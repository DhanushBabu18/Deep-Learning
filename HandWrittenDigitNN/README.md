# MNIST Classification with Neural Networks
This project demonstrates a classification pipeline for the MNIST dataset using TensorFlow and Keras. The MNIST dataset consists of handwritten digits (0-9) and is a standard benchmark for image classification tasks.
## Project Overview

**1.Data Loading and Exploration:** Load the MNIST dataset and examine its structure.

**2.Data Preprocessing:** Normalize pixel values and reshape data.

**3.Model Building and Training:** Create and train different neural network models.

**4.Evaluation and Visualization:** Evaluate the models' performance and visualize results.

## Datasset
The dataset used is MNIST, which is included with TensorFlow. It is automatically downloaded when dataset is loaded.

## Results
- **Basic Model Accuracy:** ~92.55%
- **Improved Model Accuracy:** ~98.61%
- **Model with Flatten Layer Accuracy:** ~98.44%

## Usage
This project is designed to demonstrate the workflow for training and evaluating neural networks on image data. You can modify the models or preprocessing steps to fit other image classification tasks or datasets.
