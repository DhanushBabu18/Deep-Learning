# Customer Churn Prediction
This project involves analyzing customer churn data to predict which customers are likely to churn from a telecommunications company. It uses various data processing techniques and builds an Artificial Neural Network (ANN) model to make predictions.
## Project Overview

**1.Data Loading and Exploration:** Load customer churn data from a CSV file and perform initial exploration.

**2.Data Cleaning:** Address missing values and convert categorical variables to numerical formats.

**3.Data Preprocessing:** Apply scaling and one-hot encoding to prepare data for modeling.

**4.Model Building:** Train an Artificial Neural Network (ANN) using TensorFlow and Keras.

**5.Evaluation:** Assess the modelâ€™s performance and make predictions.

## Dataset
The dataset used is WA_Fn-UseC_-Telco-Customer-Churn.csv. It's placed under this folder in the Deep-Learning directory.

## Results
- **Model Accuracy:** 79.70%
- **Loss:** 0.4380
- 
## Usage
You can use this project to predict customer churn based on various features such as tenure, monthly charges, and service usage. Modify the dataset and the model parameters to fit your specific use case.
