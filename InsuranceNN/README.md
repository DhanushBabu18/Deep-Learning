# Insurance Prediction with Neural Networks
This project demonstrates a binary classification pipeline for predicting whether individuals will buy insurance based on their age and affordability. The model is built using TensorFlow and Keras.
## Project Overview
**1.Data Loading and Exploration:** Load and explore the insurance data.

**2.Data Preprocessing:** Prepare data for training by scaling and splitting.

**3.Model Building and Training:** Create and train a neural network model.

**4.Evaluation and Prediction:** Evaluate the model's performance and make predictions.

## Data
The dataset used is insurance_data.csv, which is placed in the project directory under the folder InsuranceNN. The file contains columns: age, affordibility, and bought_insurance.

## Results

### Model Evaluation
**Accuracy:** 100%

**Loss:** 0.3276
